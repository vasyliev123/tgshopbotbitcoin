## Requirements, Installation & Usage

Please refer to the [main greed project fork](https://github.com/Steffo99/greed) for requirements, installation guide, and usage instructions before proceeding with the bitcoin setup below

## Integrating Bitcoin
1. Edit the `config/config.toml` file to set your Blockonomics *api_key* from [Blockonomics Merchants > Stores](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores), and a *secret* of your choosing, you'll use this secret while setting up the Callback URL below.

2. Add a new [store](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores) and set the HTTP Callback URL

	Below are instructions on how to deploy your bot to obtain a Callback URL using Ngrok or Heroku.

	### Deploy using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
	* In a new terminal/cmd prompt, start the bitcoin callback listener on port 5000 `python3 -OO callback.py`
	* In another terminal/cmd prompt, start ngrok on port 5000 `./ngrok http 5000` or `~/ngrok http 5000`
	* Copy the Forwarding URL from ngrok.

	* Set the HTTP Callback URL for your [store](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores). Combine the Forwarding URL with `/callback?secret=YOUR_SECRET`, substituting in your chosen secret from step 2 in place of `YOUR_SECRET`
	   eg.  http://c7f7ecb92ht5.ngrok.io/callback?secret=aN32nFjf4

	### Deploy using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
	* Test using heroku cli command: `heroku local`
	* You will also be able to login to heroku and push your bot to heroku master to launch it into production using the following commands:
	```
	git init .
	git add .
	git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku"
	heroku login -i
	heroku git:remote -a {your-heroku-project-name}
	git push heroku master
	```
	* You can now start the greed bot and blockonomics callback from the Heroku Dashboard > Resources.

	* Set the HTTP Callback URL for your [store](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores) , combine the Heroku App URL with `/callback?secret=YOUR_SECRET`, substituting in your chosen secret from step 2 in place of `YOUR_SECRET`
		eg. https://greed.herokuapp.com/callback?secret=aN32nFjf4

That's it! Restart your bot and start accepting bitcoing payments with your bot!
