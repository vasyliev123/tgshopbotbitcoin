## Integrating Bitcoin

1. Edit the `config/config.toml` file to set the below settings
```[Bitcoin]
# Blockonomics API key
api_key = "BLOCKONOMICS_API_KEY"
secret = "YOUR_SECRET"
```
- *api_key* can be obtained by signing up on [Blockonomics Merchants](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores) and navigating to  > [Stores](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores), 
- *secret* can be any long phrase of your choice like *GreedBtc9123*

2. Add a new store at [Blockonomics Merchants > Stores](https://www.blockonomics.co/merchants#/stores), and set your Callback URL to `https://www.blockonomics.co/api/test_callback?secret=YOUR_SECRET`, substituting in your chosen secret from step 1 in place of `YOUR_SECRET`

That's it! Restart your bot and start accepting bitcoin payments with your bot!
